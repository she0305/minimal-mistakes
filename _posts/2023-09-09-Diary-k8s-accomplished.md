# Finally, I feel like I'm moving forward

You wouldn't even believe how happy I was when I saw my own Kubernetes cluster running and serving. Recently, my team has been working on a project to migrate our application to Kubernetes. I've always wanted to learn Kubernetes, but I never had a chance to do it. I was so excited when I heard this project was kicking off!

Despite the fact that I watched a few videos and read about Kubernetes before, I felt like I couldn't touch the code as I was scared of breaking things. At the same time, my body was itching to get my hands dirty. I was excited every second I spent on the project, and I was so happy that my team adopted this new technology. 

I wanted to own the project and be the one who knows the most about Kubernetes. I wanted to be the one who can help others (despite the fact that I'm the least experienced with Kubernetes in the DevOps team). So I decide to practice my Kubernetes skills by creating my own cluster. 

Last weekend was a long weekend, and I spent all three days just working on my cluster. In the beginning, I wasn't even sure if I could do it. There were so many times that I was stuck or going in the wrong direction. But I kept going, and I finally got to the point where I could deploy `whoami`, which is a simple web application that prints the hostname of the pod it runs on.

It's crazy that I felt so accomplished and happy to the point that I got chills when I saw the `whoami` pod running. I know it's just a simple web application, but I felt like I was finally moving forward. I was so happy that I could finally understand the concept of Kubernetes and how it works.

Ever since then, I woke up an hour earlier than my usual work time to work on my team's cluster. Obviously, my team's cluster is much more complicated than my own cluster, so I am still in the "learning" position rather than the "leading" position. But I feel so lucky that I have other team members who are willing to teach me and help me. I feel so live everyday now!

I want to shout out to my young mentor who has been teaching me Kubernetes and DevOps. I feel extremely lucky to come across someone who is so smart and inspiring. I hope I can be as good as him one day! I know he would say stop being so cringy, but I want to leave this here so that I can look back at this post and laugh together one day :D
