# VIM vimtutor

I've always wanted to be good at Vim. I've tried to learn it a few times, but I always ended up turning it off since I never got used to it. A few days ago I just got bored and decided to go through "vimtutor" for fun, and I think I finally got the hang of it.

If you've never heard of vimtutor before, it's a built-in tutorial that comes with Vim. You can access it by typing "vimtutor" in your terminal. It walks you through the basics of Vim and you can practice what you learn right away.
