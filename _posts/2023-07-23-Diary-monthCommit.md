# 1/3 of the way there

If you have been following my blog, you know that I have been doing [every day commit challenge](https://she0305.github.io/diary/Diary-everydayCommit1/). I am happy to announce that I have completed 1 month of the challenge. I am 1/3 of the way there!! 

I honestly didn't think I would make it this far. Despite the fact that I have been enjoying learning to code, there were few days I found particularly challenging.

1. I wanted to focus on finishing tutorials/classes rather than context switching just for the sake of "writing" code - as I was studying with Harvard C50 alongside
2. I struggled to solve a bug that I'd write bunch of codes but end up deleting them all
3. Personal events such as sleeping over at my friend's house or going on a trip made it difficult to commit since I didn't want to look too nerdy in front of my friends

I'm still trying to figure out the best way to make this "every day commit challenge" worth the way it will benefit me the most. As the goal is not to be obsessed with the "checking the box", but to be able to push myself to proactively act/code to fail fast and learn fast. (There were certainly the days I was just checking the box, but there were definitely more days that I was able to make good progress through learning by doing) 

## Progress

Here is the picture of my GitHub contribution that I just took. As you see, you can't see the white blank space in July! Definitely not the most impressive GitHub contribution as there are definitely days with just one commit, but it's the consistency that gives me the confidence to trust my ability to keep going.

## Thoughts

It's pretty incredible that how much I have learned in this month. I feel like I can finally understand some concepts that I've been struggling, and I feel like maybe I'm capable of understanding some parts of software engineering. Honestly, I got pretty lucky that I have a friend who's been encouraging and supporting me whenever I feel like I'm not making any progress, so it's probably the combination of this challenge and my friend's support that I was able to make it this far. I'm grateful and excited to see what I will learn in the next 2 months!!
