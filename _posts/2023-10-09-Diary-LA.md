# Fortune !

I woke up at 5:15 am today in PST to work with my team in EST. Although I'm allowed to work asynchronously, I didn't want to miss any opportunity to learn from my team. I know, I sound way too nerdy, but I just enjoy my work haha. Part of me was also scared that I might miss out on something important or that I lose my momentum of learning if I go to any sort of vacation.

Unlike my worries, the sunlight in LA helped me energize and make me feel a lot more motivated. I went to beach and enjoyed watercolor painting under the beautiful weather. Feels like a dream.

I was almost at the point where I was burnt out from a long sprint, and didn't know how to deal with it. Despite the fact my body was telling me that I should take a break, my brain kept telling me that I just wasn't grinding hard enough to keep up with the pace. I'm glad I took some time off to recharge myself. I feel so lucky and grateful!
