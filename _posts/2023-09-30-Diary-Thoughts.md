# Just Random Thoughts

If you know me well, you probably know that I like to draw, record videos, and edit them. Although I don't love cooking, I do think I'm pretty good at it. 

I was never really good at math, but I was pretty good at literature at least in Korean. But I always thought science and math were more important than literature, and they are cooler too. That's why I chose to study engineering, and became an engineer.

I totally agree with the fact that we should focus on our strengths rather than weaknesses. However, for me, it's the "coolness" that matters a lot. I think coding and developing is so cool that I want to be good at it. I think devOps is awesome, and I want to be an expert in it.

But what makes me happy and feel accomplished is the recognition from myself. I feel like I'm in a constant battle with myself with coding because I know I'm behind. 

What would be the right decision? Should I focus on my strengths and really invest in them? Or should I just pursue what I think is cool and be good at it?

I keep asking myself this question, and I think I know the answer already. But just a thought.
