# Working for hours and not being able to commit a single line

Today was horrible. I worked on a bug for an entire day, like 10 hours almost, and all my tries didn't work. I was lost, and I felt defeated. 

I removed all my codes after none of my tries worked. My code looked like no one has ever touched it since the last commit. Despite all my effort and time, I couldn't commit a single line.

One thing I struggle a lot these days is that I don't know when to stop trying. I keep thinking that I'm almost there, and I just need to try one more thing. Part of me knows that this will come with experience, but it's hard to figure out the right balance between trying and moving on. 

People say that all my time that seems worthless will not go wasted, and I'm a huge believer of that. But it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel when you are in the tunnel. 

The dark side of me is telling me that it's just because I'm not smart enough, but oh well. I'm not convinced, and even if it's true, I mean, I like doing this. So I'll keep coding, I guess.

As once Dora said from Finding Nemo, "When life gets you down, do you wanna know what you've gotta do? Just keep swimming, just keep swimming, just keep swimming, swimming, swimming."

I feel better after humming this song. I'm going to sleep now. Good night.
