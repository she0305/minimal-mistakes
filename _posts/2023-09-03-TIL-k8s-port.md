# How to set up Kubernetes Dashboard

## 1. Install Kubernetes Dashboard

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.3.1/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml
```

You can check if the dashboard is installed by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl get ns
```

If you see `kubernetes-dashboard` namespace, it means the dashboard is installed.

You should be able to run the following command to see the dashboard pods and services:

```bash
kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get all
```

```bash
kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard describe service kubernetes-dashboard
```

## 2. Access the dashboard

When you run the following command, you should see the dashboard service does not have an external IP address.

```bash
kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get svc
```

### 2.1. Access the dashboard using port-forwarding

When you described the dashboard service, you should see the target port is 8443. You can use port-forwarding to access the dashboard. Make sure to use the correct pod name shown in the `kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get all` command.

```bash
kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard port-forward kubernetes-dashboard-6c7ccbcf87-sft4n 8000:8443
```
Now you should be able to access the dashboard at `https://localhost:8000/`

### 2.2. Access the dashboard using a proxy

When you need to access the dashboard only when you needed, you can use a proxy. Using proxy will expose the dashboard outside the cluster while the proxy is running.

You can use the following command to start a proxy:

```bash
kubectl proxy
```

### 2.3. Access the dashboard using a NodePort

You can also use a NodePort to access the dashboard. You can use the following command to create a NodePort service:

```bash
kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard edit svc kubernetes-dashboard
```

Then find `type: ClusterIP` and change it to `type: NodePort`. You can run the following command to see the dashboard service has `NodePort` type now. You can also add a port number to the `nodePort` field. If you don't specify the port number, Kubernetes will assign a random port number. Here, I used 32323 as the port number, which I added under the targetPort field.

```bash
kubectl -n kubernetes-dashboard get svc
```

Now, get the internal IP address of the node by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

Finally, you can add the IP address to your `hosts` file. For linux, you can find the `hosts` file at `/etc/hosts`. For Windows, you can find it at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`. Add the following line to the `hosts` file:

```bash
cat /etc/hosts
```

Copy the IP address of the node and add it to the `hosts` file. Then Ctrl + D to save and exit.

Now, you should be able to access the dashboard at `https://<node-name>:32323/`.


### 2.4. Access the dashboard using an Ingress

This is the method that I will be using. First, check your DNS provider and make sure you have a domain name. I'm going to use subdomain for my dashboard. 

Then, you need to install an Ingress controller. I'm using Nginx Ingress controller. You can install it by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.8.1/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
```

You can check if the Ingress controller is installed by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
```

Now, create a namespace for the dashboard:

```bash
kubectl create ns kubernetes-dashboard
```

Then, create an ingress.yaml file:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: dashboard-ingress
  namespace: kubernetes-dashboard #should match with service and pod
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
    - host: dashboard.amyapproved.me
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: kubernetes-dashboard
                port:
                  number: 443
```

Kubernetes dashboard uses HTTPS by default. So, you need to add `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: "HTTPS"` to the annotations. Also, make sure to add the correct host name. You can use `kubectl get svc -n kubernetes-dashboard` to get the service name and port number.

I had some trouble with the ingress. So I ran `kubectl -n <namespace> port-forwad <servicename> <portnumber>` to make sure the service is working. Then I ran `kubectl -n <namespace> describe svc <servicename>` to see if the service is using the correct port number. I also ran `kubectl -n <namespace> describe ingress <ingressname>` to see if the ingress is using the correct service name and port number.

In my case, it looked like this:
```bash
kubectl -n ingress-nginx port-forward service/ingress-nginx-controller 8000:80
```
Then I went to `http://localhost:8000/` and confirmed that the service is working locally.


Below command gave me the IP address of the ingress controller which I pointed my domain A name to. Then I pointed CNAME to that A name.

```bash
k describe svc ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx
```

I burned my long weekend setting up this kubernetes dashboard. I hope this post will save you some time!
