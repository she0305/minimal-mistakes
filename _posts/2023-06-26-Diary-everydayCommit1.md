# Everyday Commit ðŸ“–

I've decided to start a new challenge for myself: committing everyday for the next 100 days. I realize that I watch a lot of tutorials and read a lot of articles, but I don't actually practice what I learn. I'm hoping that this challenge will help me to actually practice and bring me the joy of building something.

You can take a look at my commit history as of today (June 26, 2023) below. It's not too bad, but I rarely commit on the weekends. I'm hoping that this challenge can push me to getting into the habit of committing or developing everyday.

## Rules
Before I start, I want to set some rules for myself. As the goal of this challenge is to get into the **habit** of committing everyday, I don't want this experience to be too stressful. Also, I will be applying what I learned from reading [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) by James Clear.

1. I will commit everyday for the next 100 days.
2. It doesn't matter how many lines of code I write, I just need to commit something.
3. I need to prioritize the commit that shows visual progress (e.g. adding a new feature, fixing a bug, etc.) over the commit that only changes the documentation. â€” Rewarding my brain
4. I will reserve at least 30 minutes everyday to work on my personal project.

## Goals
While the broad goal of this challenge is to get into the habit of committing everyday, I want to set some specific goals for myself.
1. I want to build a community website by myself
2. I want to learn Next.js
3. I want to practice TypeScript

## Thoughts
My real goal gets exposed here: I want to gain confidence. As a self-taught developer, despite the fact that I've been working as a software engineer for almost a year now, I still feel like I'm not good enough. I still feel like I'm not a real software engineer, and this feeling is holding me back from truly enjoying my work. Recently, I realized that only way to overcome this feeling would be to show myself that I can build something. I want to build something that I can be proud of, and I want to build something that I can show to others. I want to build something that I can call my own. I want to build something that I can be confident about.

I'm excited about new struggles and new challenges that I will face during this journey.


++I debated whether I should call this challenge "growing grass ðŸŒ±challenge" or "everyday commit challenge" since my goald would be making my commit heat map look as green as possible ðŸ˜Œ.
