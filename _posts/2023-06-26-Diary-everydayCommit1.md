# Everyday Commit ðŸ“–

I've decided to start a new challenge for myself: committing everyday for the next 100 days. I realize that I watch a lot of tutorials and read a lot of articles, but I don't actually practice what I learn. I'm hoping that this challenge will help me to actually practice and bring me the joy of building something.

You can take a look at my commit history as of today (June 26, 2023) below. It's not too bad but I rarely commit on the weekends.

I debated whether I should call this challenge "growing grass ðŸŒ±challenge" or "everyday commit challenge" since my goald would be making my commit heat map look as green as possible ðŸ˜Œ. 

I will be working on my new project, building a community website. I'm excited to build using Next.js as it'd be my first time using it. I will be documenting more about the project layout and the process of building it in the next few days.
