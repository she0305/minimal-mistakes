# Pause to Breath

I decided to pause on my 100 days of commit challenge. It's been 63 days, almost 1/3 way through. I definitely learned so much more than I expected. I sprinted and pushed myself while studying and coding till 1 am almost every day. 

Still, every day was fun, and it wasn't like I set a goal to study till 1 am. Every day I just realized it was already 1 a.m. and I should go to bed.

You probably wonder why I'm pausing then. It's because I realized committing does not reflect how much I learned. As I moved to DevOps role, I had to read many books and videos to understand the pipeline implementation. Rushing to writing code without understanding the concept for the sake of committing would defeat the purpose of this whole challenge. 

I hated to stop the challenge, and someone might think I didn't have enough grit to continue. But I think it's more important to be honest with myself and learn to be flexible.

Also, another reason why I'm pausing is that I want to pour more time and focus into my work. Rather than spreading my effort and energy, I want to focus on one thing and do it well. I've been spending a lot of time studying after work hours to have the level of the understanding I want to have at work. I started to feel a little overwhelmed by the fact that I have too much to pursue at the same time. I think it's time to prioritize and focus on one thing at a time.
