# Pause to Breath

I decided to pause on my 100 days of commit challenge. It's been 63 days, almost 1/3 way through. I definitely learned so much more than I expected. I sprinted and pushed myself while studying and coding till 1 am almost every day. 

Still, every day was fun, and it wasn't like I set a goal to study till 1 am. Every day I just realized it was already 1 am and I should go to bed.

You probably wonder why I'm pausing then. It's because I realized committing does not reflect how much I learned. As I moved to DevOps role, I had to read many books and videos to understand the pipeline implementation. Rushing to writing code without understanding the concept for the sake of committing would defeat the purpose of this whole challenge. 

I hated to stop the challenge, and someone might think I didn't have enough grit to continue. But I think it's more important to be honest with myself and learn to be flexible.
