# Studying for CKA

I've always hated taking tests. Just thinking about test makes the learning process less fun. However, I'm feeling a little different about the CKA exam. Although I barely started learning Kubernetes, I'm learning with excitement. I truly think Kubernetes is so cool, and I want to be an expert in it. So if I'm going to learn it anyway, why not take the exam and get a certificate?

It's pretty awesome that I have a manager who genuinely wants me to learn and grow that he's willing to support me to take the exam. I feel so excited to wake up every morning, learn cool devOps stuff, and work with my awesome team, who are all inspiring and patient.

I really hope this preparation for this CKA exam will also boost my performance at work and help me grow as a devOps engineer.

I dream for the day when I can troubleshoot and fix random issues that occur in the cluster. Again, the goal is to really understand the system and be able to own it. I am going to take my time to understand rather than just memorizing to pass the exam.
