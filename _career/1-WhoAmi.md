## Start of my career 🏭

I started my career as an industrial engineer on the manufacturing floor with the belief that a “true engineer” should understand what’s happening on the floor. 

**Role 👩‍🔧:** Industrial Engineer Co-Op<br/>
**Responsibilities 🛠️:** Keeping the production line running smoothly by identifying and solving problems. <br/>
**Amy's Impact 🔥:** Improved the production line efficiency by 10% by implementing a flag system to indicate the change in the incoming product. <br/> 
**Take away 🎁:** Ability to work under pressure and visualize the big picture.

</p>

## Start of PowerPoint 📊 and Excel 📈

With the confidence that I can understand the manufacturing process, I moved to the quality engineering team, where I met many different people.  

**Role 👩‍🔧:** Supplier Quality Engineer Co-Op <br/>
**Responsibilities 🛠️:** Ensuring the quality of the product by investigating the root cause of the problem and implementing corrective actions. <br/>
**Amy's Impact 🔥:** Reserved ~$400,000 in cost savings through the implementation of 7 different corrective actions. <br/>
**Take away 🎁:** Being able to use data to present the solution to the higher management.

## Switching the industry 🍫

After a year of working in the appliance industry, I decided to switch to the food industry for a change. I joined the Hershey Company as a project engineer.

**Role 👩‍🔧:** Project Engineer Intern<br/>
**Responsibilities 🛠️:** Analyzing the current manufacturing process and providing solutions to improve the process. <br/>
**Amy's Impact 🔥:** Analyzed production bottleneck issue and identified impacted areas in penuche processes; recommended solutions to increase the production by 9%, 40%, 220%. The company later invested $1.8M to adopt the solution alongside the site expansion. <br/>
**Take away 🎁:** Being able to use data to present the solution to the higher management.

## Start of my journey with Rolls-Royce 🛫

Got selected for the Rolls-Royce International Program! (Unfortunately, the pandemic happened and was converted to a remote program 😢)

**Role 👩‍🔧:** Mechanical Engineer Intern<br/>
**Responsibilities 🛠️:** Conduct a study for gear train design efficiency on different gear sizes for Trent 7000 <br/>
**Amy's Impact 🔥:** Analyzed the current gear train design and identified an optimal gear structure to reduce current cost by 0.6%  <br/>
**Take away 🎁:** Being able to work with a global team and utilize the resources to effectively achieve the goal of the project. <br/>
**Take away 2 🎁:** Got some time to pause and think about what I like. (Built my own PC and started to wonder about the software side of the engineering.)

## Graduate Development Program 🎓

In 2021, I joined Rolls-Royce as a graduate development program engineer. I was assigned to the Engineering Operations Management team for the first rotation.

-----------------------------  First Rotation (EOM) --------------------------- <br/>

**Role 👩‍🔧:** Project Manager Assistant<br/>
**Responsibilities 🛠️:** Led and supported various process improvement projects involving software solution such as RRMS and supplier audit program  <br/>
**Amy's Impact 🔥:** Presented the solution to utilize the existing internal website to add the data collection feature for the supplier audit program. The project is currently in the implementation phase. <br/>
**Take away 🎁:** My first experience with working with software engineers and understanding the software development process. Seeing how the software can be used to solve the common but complex problem was fascinating. <br/>

---------------------------  Second Rotation (Helo) -------------------------- <br/>

**Role 👩‍🔧:** Design Engineer<br/>
**Responsibilities 🛠️:** Led design improvement projects such as oil leakage issue<br/>
**Amy's Impact 🔥:** Presented solutions to design challenges and obtained approvals for four different improvement projects. Published two technical reports <br/>
**Amy's Impact 🔥:** Initiated and delivered Helo Aftermarket Material Reviewer (HAMR) app to efficiently monitor material holds, saving ~$40,000 <br/>
**Take away 🎁:** Developed an app for the first time with the help of the Software Factory team. Something sparked in me, and I wanted to learn more about software development. <br/>

--------------------  Last Rotation (Software Factory) ------------------- <br/>

**Role 👩‍🔧:** Software Engineer<br/>
**Responsibilities 🛠️:** Learn and support internal-facing software such as 3DT (Dynamic Data Deliverable Tracker) and SAF (Safty Assurance Framework)<br/>
**Amy's Impact 🔥:** Developed backend API for 3DT, SAF, SD, and exVibe <br/>
**Take away 🎁:** This is where I belong<br/>

## Here I am! - with Software Factory 🎉

I'm extremely lucky with the all 7 positions I had so far. I was able to learn and grow from each of them and finally found my passion. I never thought I would be a software engineer, but here I am!
